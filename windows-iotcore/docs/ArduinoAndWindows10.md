# Arduino and Windows 10
Arduino and Windows 10 work together to help you make amazing projects - get started by clicking one of the links below. Our technologies support the Arduino Uno and Mega, as well as the new Arduino 101.

## Arduino Wiring for Windows 10 IoT Core Devices


[![Arduino Wiring](../media/ArduinoAndWindows10/Lighning_0.png)](ArduinoWiring)

To enable the use of the familiar[Arduino Wiring](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage)language on IoT Core devices, a Visual Studio project template for Arduino Wiring is provided.<br/>The Arduino Wiring project template enables developing, deploying and debugging Arduino Wiring sketches on supported IoT Core devices.

Windows Remote Arduino is an open-source Windows Runtime library which allows Makers to control an Arduino through a Bluetooth, USB, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet connection. It enables developers to include Arduino sensors in their Windows projects, or even offload computationally expensive work from an Arduino to Windows. The Windows Remote Arduino library can be used with any WinRT languages (C++/CX, C# and JavaScript).
